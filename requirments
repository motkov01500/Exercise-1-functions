Write a program that performs arithmetic division. The program will use two integers, a and b (obtained by the user) and will perform the division a/b, store the result in another integer c and show the result of the division using cout. In a similar way, extend the program to add, subtract, multiply, do modulo and power using integers a and b. Modify your program so that when it starts, it asks the user which type of calculation it should do, then asks for the 2 integers, then runs the user selected calculation and outputs the result in a user friendly formatted manner
